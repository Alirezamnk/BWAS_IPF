# Brain-Wide Association Study

# Under construction.

This repository contains scripts to perform Brain-Wide Association Study (BWAS) to find the association between brain imaging-derived phenotypes and with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis genetic risk, as descibed in this paper: "A. R. Mohammadi-Nejad, R. J. Allen, L. Kraven, O. C. Leavy, R. G. Jenkins, D. Auer, L. V. Wain, S. N. Sotiropoulos, “Mapping brain endophenotypes associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis genetic predisposition”, eBioMedicine, 2022".

## Code Overview

Figures in our paper can be regenerated using the codes that has been assigned for each figure (Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5).
